# Lead Qualification & Enrichment Automation

An end-to-end **n8n workflow** designed to automate the lead intake, validation, enrichment, and routing process. This system filters out low-quality leads, calculates lead scores, and triggers personalized engagement via Slack, Gmail, and Google Calendar.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This workflow acts as an automated **Sales Development Representative (SDR)**. It handles everything from initial form submission to booking meetings for high-value leads, ensuring your sales team only focuses on qualified opportunities.

## ✨ Features

* **Multi-Stage Validation**: Combines internal logic with **Hunter.io** to verify email deliverability and filter out temporary or fake domains.
* **Deep Lead Enrichment**: Uses the Hunter API to retrieve company details, social profiles, and industry group data.
* **CRM Integration**: Syncs with **Airtable** to check existing customer status (New, General, or VIP) and revenue history.
* **Dynamic Lead Scoring**: A custom logic engine categorizes leads into High, Medium, and Low value based on geography, industry (e.g., Software), and email scores.
* **Automated Document Generation**: Creates a personalized "Lead Brief" in Google Docs, converts it to PDF, and stores it in Google Drive.
* **Sales Orchestration**:
    * **High Value**: Immediate Slack alert to Account Executives and automated Google Calendar scheduling.
    * **Medium Value**: Triggers an approval workflow via Gmail for manual manager review.
    * **Low Value**: Automatically added to a "Nurture List" in Google Sheets.
